**How would you pitch your game in one line? **
A 2D simulation game where you build servers, colocate them, wire them up and build your own infrastructure in a competitive market

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? **
Handling weird support requests, Story-based Orders (mixed with some generic ones), Sourcing server components, Building up a network, Customer based leveling, Choosing the right balance between cheap and good (best case it's both)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) **
A 2D simulation game where the player builds servers from scratch or modifies used ones and then tries to rent them out via different methods (Virtual Servers, Webhosting, etc.).
All of these methods will have different advantages and disadvantages in terms of support, server usage and licensing costs

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will keep playing because of the options that they will unlock later in the game (more services and the option to expand with your own global fiber network and multiple Datacenters)
